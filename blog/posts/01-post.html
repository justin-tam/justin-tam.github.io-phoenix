            <h3>What is a REIT?</h3>
	    <p>
		A real estate investment trust, or REIT (pronounced reet), is a unique type of
		company that allows investors to pool their money to invest in real estate assets.
		Some REITs simply buy properties and rent them to tenants, others develop properties
		from the ground up, and some don’t even own properties at all, choosing to focus on
		the mortgage and financial side of real estate.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Although this is an oversimplification, you can think of a REIT like a mutual fund for
		real estate. Hundreds or thousands of investors buy shares and contribute money to a
		pool, and professional managers decide how to invest it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		The purpose of REITs is to allow everyday investors to be able to invest in real estate
		assets that they otherwise wouldn’t be able to. For example, could you go out and buy a
		high-rise office tower or shopping mall? Could you buy a portfolio of mortgages, or
		would you even know how to go about doing this? Probably not. However, REITs allow you
		to put your money to work in these ways. You can even gain exposure to billion-dollar
		commercial property portfolios with just a few hundred dollars to start.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Why a REIT?</h3>
	    <p>
		REITs can be a source of reliable, growing income. Because most property-owning REITs
		lease their properties on a long-term basis, REITs can be nicely set up for steady income,
		quarter after quarter. There’s definitely far less variance in the quarter-to-quarter
		profits of well-run REITs than there is for most other companies, including those that
		are generally thought of as "stable."
	    </p>
	    <p>
		If you want to invest in real estate, REITs can be a very easy way to get started.
		There’s excellent return potential in owning investment properties outright, but there’s
		a lot of work involved with direct real estate investments, even if you hire a property
		manager to oversee their day-to-day operations. You can buy shares of any publicly
		traded REIT with the simple click of a button, and without any ongoing maintenance worries.
