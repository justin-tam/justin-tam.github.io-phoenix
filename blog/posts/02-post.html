            <h3>Vision and Values</h3>
	    <p>
		We focus our real estate investment strategy on acquiring properties in growing
		markets that show improving demographic trends, and target properties in amenable
		locations to ensure the viability of the real estate location for the tenants.
		Our acquisitions team uncovers opportunities consistent with this strategy. Our
		research department uses its underwriting expertise to assess tenants' long-term
		prospects beforehand and then we seek to maintain tenant, industry, and geographic
		diversification through our acquisitions and portfoli management strategies.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Our relationships with high net worth investors and commercial banks allow us to
		continually grow and build on our successes, while our conservative balance sheet
		keeps our costs low and offers financial stability through various economic cycles.
		At Phoenix Imperial, we treat money seriously. No dollar is misspent, no penny is
		unaccounted for. Efficiency, growth, and transparency are how we operate. We
		invite and encourage our investors to review our annual reports so that they may
		better understand how we operate.
            </p>
            <h3>Why now?</h3>
	    <p>
		2020 has taught us that nothing is guaranteed in life. Whether it's hurricanes,
		wildfires, pandemics, economic shutdowns, riots, or any other number of natural
		and man-made disasters, this year has shown us that we cannot predict the future.
		With this in mind, the importance of diversity and long-term stability have never
		been more necessary for our financial health. That's why we formed Phoenix
		Imperial. To provide a safer, growth oriented alternative to the volatility of the
		market, and a more reliable source of income than government bonds and 401(k)s.
            </p>

		If steady income through real estate is something you'd like to hear more about,
		reach out to us via our contact form. If you're still on the fence, read on to
		learn more about how Phoenix Imperial can help you take that extra vacation,
		save for retirement, expand your nest egg, and perhaps become a real estate mogul.
