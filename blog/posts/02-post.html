            <h3>Vision and Values</h3>
	    <p>
		We focus our real estate investment strategy on acquiring properties in growing
		markets that show improving demographic trends, and target properties in strategic
		locations to ensure the viability of the real estate location for the tenants.
		Our acquisitions team uncovers opportunities consistent with this strategy.
		Our research department uses its underwriting expertise to assess the tenantsâ€™
		long-term prospects beforehand and then we seek to maintain tenant, industry, and
		geographic diversification through our acquisitions, portfolio management and asset
		management strategies.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Our relationships with high net worth investors and commercial banks allow us to
		continually grow and build on our successes, while our conservative balance sheet
		keeps our costs low and offers financial stability through various economic cycles.
            </p>
