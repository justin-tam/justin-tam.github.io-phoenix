            <h3>Why now?</h3>
	    <p>
		2020 has taught us that nothing is guaranteed in life. Whether it's hurricanes,
		wildfires, pandemics, economic shutdowns, riots, or any other number of natural
		and man-made disasters, this year has shown us that we cannot predict the future.
		With this in mind, the importance of diversity and long-term stability have never
		been more necessary for our financial health. That's why we formed Phoenix
		Imperial. To provide a safer, growth oriented alternative to the volatility of the
		market, and a more reliable source of income than government bonds and 401(k)s.
            </p>

		If steady income through real estate is something you'd like to hear more about,
		reach out to us via our contact form. If you're still on the fence, read on to
		learn more about how Phoenix Imperial can help you take that extra vacation,
		save for retirement, expand your nest egg, and perhaps become a real estate mogul.

            <h3>What's Next?</h3>
            <p>
		This year (2020) is about vetting investors and determining whether we have the
		social support and financial foundation to grow faster than we have in the past
		few years. Assuming a successful investment campaign, Phoenix Imperial intends
		to incorporate as a Limited Liability Company to better take advantage of legal,
		financial, and tax benefits as we execute our portfolio acquisition strategy
		through 2021. Our goal is to deliver monthly dividends to our investors starting
		one year after initial investment and incrementally increasing in % return
		annually over a 5 or 10 year period based on the selected investment product.
            </p>
	    <p>
		If you read the prior two pieces, then you've learned about REITs and how they
		are great vehicles for real estate investments. Phoenix Imperial's plan of action
		moving forward consists of building up the necessary components to transition our
		organization into a REIT so that as we grow and expand, we may better pass those
		legal, financial, and tax benefits onto our investors. Until then, we here at
		Phoenix Imperial intend to continue serving our investors, our tenants, and our
		communities with the utmost respect and care as we grow our portfolio and stay
		vigilant for investment opportunities from sudden market shifts.
